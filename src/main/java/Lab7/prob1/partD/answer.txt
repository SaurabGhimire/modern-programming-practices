The key of a HashMap should be final.
Here, after setting the key once, when we encounter the key again,
we are changing the values inside the key, which would consider it the new key.

Note that even though the code has four similar entries of "(Richard, 55000)" in duplicate array.
Once, we execute remove duplicates, if we print the list we get only two entries of "(Richard, 55000)".
Because on second occurrence, the boolean value "visited" is changed to "true".

The Key can be made immutable by setting the "Employee" class final and
removing all setters.

if(!tracker.containsKey(e)) {
    tracker.put(e, e);
    noDupsList.add(e);
} else {
    tracker.get(e).setVisited(true);
}
