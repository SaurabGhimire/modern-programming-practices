Employee class does not override "equals()" method of parent class "Object".

Even though the class "Employee" class has "equals" method, due to different method signature,
compiler treats this method as instance method.

The current implementation has method signature as : public String equals(Employee obj)
The method signature should be : public String equals(Object obj)

Also, while overriding the method signature, we need to compare for the memory location first.
Then check the className. After that, we need to check value of each instance fields.

@Override
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if(this == obj) return  true;
    if(obj== null || getClass() !=  obj.getClass()) return  false;
    Employee e = (Employee) obj;
    return e.name.equals(name) && e.salary == salary;
}
